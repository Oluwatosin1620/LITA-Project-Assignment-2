### Project Overview
This is an analysis and visualization of customer data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, to subscription trends of customers. This project, part of my GitHub portfolio, also showcases my proficiency in data storytelling and highlights my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights with advanced tools confidently.

### Data Source
Our facilitator provided this dataset.


### Dataset Description
This dataset provides comprehensive information on customer subscriptions, including details on individual subscription types, durations, and revenue generation. The primary aim is to analyze customer behaviours, subscription trends, and revenue patterns across different regions, helping to guide marketing and retention strategies. This data contains 33,787 rows and 8 columns, while an additional column was added in the cleaning process, making it a total of 9 columns.

---

### Key Features:
**CustomerID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
**CustomerName**: The name of the customer.
**Region**: The geographical region where the customer is located, useful for analyzing trends based on location.
**SubscriptionType**: The type of subscription each customer has selected.
**SubscriptionStart**: The date when the customer's subscription began.
**SubscriptionEnd**: The date when the customer's subscription is scheduled to end.
**Cancelled**: An indicator denoting whether the customer has cancelled their subscription.
**Revenue**: The total revenue generated from each customerâ€™s subscription.


### Data Tools
* Microsoft Excel, for:
  > Data cleaning;
  > Data Analysis and Summarization.
* SQL [Structured Query Language] for Querying data
* Power BI for Data Visualization
* GitHub for Portfolio building


## Microsoft Excel [VIEW PROJECT](https://us.docworkspace.com/d/sIBKeupNZsc6YuQY)
---
Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet tool for data organization (cleaning and preparation), analysis, and visualization. It offers formulas, pivot tables, and charts, enabling users to manage and interpret data.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Processing the raw data to ensure it is ready for analysis. Steps taken:
> Removing Duplicates: The initial rows of the data were 50001, but after removing duplicates, 33787 rows were left. No missing values were found; 
> Adding filters


### Exploratory Data Analysis
The following insights will be drawn:
* Which region has the largest revenue?
* What is the most popular subscription type?
* What is the total revenue by subscription type?
* Which region has the most cancelled subscriptions? Top 3.
* What is the total number of active and cancelled subscriptions?
* What is the total duration of subscription in each region?
* What is the cancellation rate by customers?
* How many customers are with subscriptions longer than 12 months?
* How many customers cancelled their subscriptions within 6 months?
* What is the total number of customers by subscription?
* Which region is best for business?
* Which region should the business focus more on?
* What is the total revenue derived from each subscription type?
* What is the average subscription duration for all customers? And many more...


  ### Data Visualization
  **Pivot Table** a data summarization tool found in MS Excel was used for visualization.
  
**Insights Derived**:
1. **Which region has the largest revenue**:

**key Finding**
Based on this analysis, the East Region has the highest revenue, followed by the South Region, while the North Region has the lowest revenue. The business is doing well in all regions. The basic subscription type should be introduced in the south and west regions. which will also bring more revenue to the business.

2. **What is the average subscription duration for all customers**;

**Key Finding**
This analysis shows that all subscription durations have equal span.

3. **What is the total duration of subscription in each region**;

![Total Product by Month and Region](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaa55f49-39b6-4f95-bc80-ec2a4d9ae108)

**Key Findings**
In this analysis, lots of insights were generated. It answers the questions:

  * What is the total No of products sold in 2023? **5,952**
  * How many product types were sold in each month? **1**
  * How many products were sold in Jan? **496**

In Summary, the business focuses on a particular type of product and a specific region each month. There was only a change in the product type in August when the business initially sold shoes in 2023 but later changed to selling Hats in 2024.  
  

## SQL (STANDARD QUERY LANGUAGE)
---
It is used for querying, storing and managing data in a database. The following queries: were derived in the analysis:

**Insights Derived**:
1. Retrieve the total number of customers from each region:

~~~ SQL
SELECT region, count(customerID) as TotalCustomers
from [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset11]
Group by region
order by TotalCustomers
~~~

2. Find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers:

~~~ SQL
SELECT SubscriptionType, count(customerid) as MostPopular
FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset11]
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY MostPopular
~~~

3. Find customers who cancelled their subscription within 6 months:
   
~~~ SQL
select *,
   DATEDIFF(month, SubscriptionStart, subscriptionend) as subscription_month
from [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset11]
where
    canceled = 1
    and DATEDIFF(month, subscriptionstart, subscriptionend) <= 6
order by 
    subscription_month;
~~~

4. Calculate the average subscription duration for all customers:

~~~ SQL
SELECT AVG(datediff(month, subscriptionstart, subscriptionend)) 
 as Averagesubscription
from [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset11]
~~~

5. Find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months:

~~~ SQL
select *,
    DATEDIFF(month, SubscriptionStart, subscriptionend) as subscription_month
from [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset11]
where
    canceled = 1
    and DATEDIFF(month, subscriptionstart, subscriptionend) >12 
order by 
    subscription_month;
~~~

6. Calculate total revenue by subscription type:

~~~ SQL
SELECT SubscriptionType, sum(CAST(revenue AS INT)) as TotalRevenue
from [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset11]
group by subscriptiontype
order by TotalRevenue
~~~

7. Find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations:

~~~ SQL
select top 3 region, count(*) as Total_cancel
from [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset11]
where canceled = 1
group by region
order by Total_Cancel desc
~~~

8. Find the total number of active and cancelled subscriptions:

~~~ SQL
select case when canceled = 0 then 'Active_Sub'
	else 'Canceled_Sub' end as Subscription_Status, 
Canceled, count(*) as Total_cancel
from [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset11]
group by canceled
order by Total_Cancel desc
~~~


## POWER BI
A data Visualization and business intelligence tool for converting data from different sources to interactive dashboards. The Excel file was loaded and transformed before visualization was performed, A calculated column was created to attain the Duration.
